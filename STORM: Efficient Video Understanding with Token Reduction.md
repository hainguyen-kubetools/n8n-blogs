## Introduction

In today’s fast-paced world of video AI, understanding dynamic video content is more crucial than ever. Traditional video-language models often struggle with continuous flow and temporal coherence, frequently missing critical motion details. This article introduces the innovative STORM model, which leverages spatiotemporal token reduction to address these challenges head-on. By integrating temporal information within the video token level, STORM achieves efficient long-video processing while significantly reducing computational overhead.

## Challenges in Video Processing

Videos are not merely a collection of static images; they embody motion, context, and continuity. However, several challenges persist with conventional approaches:

- **Loss of Motion Details:** Static frame-based analysis misses important temporal interactions.
- **High Computational Costs:** Processing long videos demands significant resources due to redundant overlapping data.
- **Inefficient Data Compression:** Overlapping frames often lead to redundant computations without effective token reduction.

The diagram below illustrates these challenges, emphasizing the difficulties encountered in continuous video processing and the resultant loss of motion cues.

These obstacles set the stage for innovative solutions like the STORM model, which is designed to tackle each of these issues effectively.

## Introducing the STORM Model

Addressing the aforementioned challenges, the STORM model—Spatiotemporal Token Reduction for Multimodal LLMs—has been developed by a collaborative team from NVIDIA, Rutgers University, UC Berkeley, MIT, Nanjing University, and KAIST. Unlike conventional video models that treat videos simply as sequences of static frames, STORM embeds temporal modeling directly at the token level. This integration capitalizes on advanced compression techniques while preserving the essential temporal context.

The image below summarizes the model's innovative approach as well as the international research collaboration behind its development.

## Model Architecture and Technical Details

At the heart of STORM is its innovative use of Mamba-based layers for enhanced temporal modeling. The architecture features a dual-purpose temporal encoder that adjusts its operation based on the input type:

- **For Images:** Functions as a spatial scanner that integrates global context.
- **For Videos:** Performs spatiotemporal scanning to capture dynamic temporal interactions.

During training, the model employs advanced token compression via spatial and temporal pooling. This two-stage approach ensures that essential details are maintained while redundant computations are minimized:

1. **Alignment Stage:** Only the temporal projector is trained, whereas both the image encoders and the language model remain frozen.
2. **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT):** A diverse dataset comprising 12.5 million samples—including text, image-text, and video-text pairs—is utilized to refine the model performance.

### Pseudo-code for Token Reduction

Below is the pseudo-code that outlines the process for token reduction within STORM:

```plaintext
function processVideoFrames(videoFrames):
    // Step 1: Encode individual frames using a pre-trained image encoder
    encodedFrames = []
    for frame in videoFrames:
        encodedFrame = imageEncoder(frame)
        encodedFrames.append(encodedFrame)

    // Step 2: Apply Mamba-based temporal projection to integrate temporal information
    temporalTokens = temporalProjector(encodedFrames)

    // Step 3: Compress tokens using spatial and temporal pooling
    compressedTokens = tokenCompression(temporalTokens)

    return compressedTokens

// During inference, the compressed tokens are passed to a language model for further reasoning
```

*Explanation: The pseudo-code demonstrates how video frames are first encoded, then enhanced with temporal data via a Mamba-based projector, and finally compressed to eliminate redundancy.*

The architectural design and training flow are visually summarized in the diagram below.
